		<p>I am soon-to-be graduate of CSU San Bernardino's Computer Science program, which taught me a wonderful breadth of critical thinking, problem solving, and practical programming skills.  However, one of the things I wish I knew more about, as a computer scientist, was web design and development.  I'd like to say this entire site was built from sheer willpower, but I had help, both from fellow students and free and open source code resources.</p>
		<p>Here is an incomplete listing and brief description of some of the more important resources I used to build this site.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href = "http://www.andrewbrinker.com">Andrew Brinker</a> and his <a href = "http://fieldguide.andrewbrinker.com/">Front End Field Guide</a> gave me a marvelous theoretical grounding and wealth of resources.  Advice from him helped shape and personalize the site.</li>
			<li><a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">The Mozilla Developer Network</a> was my go-to reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
			<li><a href = "http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> provides a marvelous <a href = "">jumping off point</a>, licensed as free software under the <a href = "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license.</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>And more will be added as I continue to develop the site!</p>
